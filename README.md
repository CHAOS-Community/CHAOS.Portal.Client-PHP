#CHAOS.Portal.Client (PHP)
This is a PHP Portal API Client. It enables easy communication with a CHAOS Portal API (protocol version 4).

##Requirements
PHP 5.3.8+ is required.  
The CURL plugin must be enabled in PHP.  

##Code
The code is located in the *src* folder.  
The file structure matches the namesspaces used and should be preserved for easy use (see examples).  
All public functions and classes have been documented in-code with [PHPDoc](http://www.phpdoc.de/) syntax,  
which should enable code completion and type hinting in most modern code IDE's.

##Examples
The examples are located in the *examples* folder. To run the examples copy the contents of the src folder  
to any path where PHP is configured to look for classes. The easiest solution is to copy the source files  
to the same folder as the example you want to run.

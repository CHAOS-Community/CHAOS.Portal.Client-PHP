#CHAOS.Portal.Client (PHP)
This is a PHP Portal API Client. It enables easy communication with a CHAOS Portal API (protocol version 4).

##Requirements
PHP 5.3.8+ is required.  
The CURL plugin must be enabled in PHP.  

##Code
The code is located in the CHAOS folder.  
The file structure matches the namesspaces used and should be preserved for easy use (see examples).

##Examples
For now there is only one example, the index.php file, which demonstrates how to connect to a Portal API and retrieve data.  
All public functions and classes have been documented in-code with [PHPDoc](http://www.phpdoc.de/) syntax,  
which should enable code completion and type hinting in most modern code IDE's.
